			- The table illustrates the proportion of national expenditure in Ireland, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Turkey on three types of consumer items in 2002.
			- Overall, the category of consumer goods that all countries spent most on was food, drinks and tobacco, which was three times higher than on the other types of goods. 
				- The lowest spending could be seen in the category of leisure and education in all five countries.
			- In terms of food, drinks and tobacco, Turkey spent the most at 32.14%. The expenditure of Ireland was also high (28.91%) compared to Sweden which spent the least (15.77%). Spain and Italy spent 18.80% and 16.36% respectively.
				- On the other hand, the lowest expenditure was on leisure and education which accounted for under 5% in all countries. Turkey spent most on these items at just 4.35% of their national expenditure which is around double that of Spain (1.98%).
			- Clothing and footwear was the third category of consumer goods and outlays for those items were between 9% in Italy and 5.40% in Sweden.  The national spending in this area for the remaining countries averaged around 6.5%.

			- The chart shows that Britain, among the four European countries Ilsted, has spent most heavily on the range of consumer goods included. 
			- In every case, British spending is considerably higher than that of other countries; only in the case of tennis racquets does another country, Italy, come close.
			 - In contrast, Germany is generally the lowest spender. This is most evident in photographic film, where Germany spends much less than Britain. Germany only spends more than another country, France, in two cases: tennis racquets and perfumes.
			 - Meanwhile, France and Italy generally maintain middle positions, averaging approximately similar spending overall. Specifically, France spends more on CDs and photographic film but less on tennis racquets than Italy does. Italy's spending on personal stereos is only marginally greater than that of France, while spending on toys is equal between the two.
			-  It is clear from the data given that there are some significant differences in spending habits within Europe.

			- The bar chart illustrates how many children, divided by gender, played six kinds of sports (tennis, badminton, cycling, swimming, football and hockey) in a town in England in 2012.
			- Overall, the number of  boys playing sport exceeded that of girls in the given period and the sport with the most significant difference between the genders was football. Football was also the most popular sport for boys while the majority of girls preferred swimming. Furthermore, both males and females least preferred playing hockey.
			- There were four sports in which boys participated more than girls. While 60 boys played football, the number of girls playing that sport was considerably lower (around 20).  With regards to tennis, the figure for boys who played that sport was 50 as opposed to just under 40 for girls. Similarly, more boys cycled than girls (approximately 35and 20 respectively). The difference, in terms of hockey, was minimal with only about 5 more boys playing that sport than girls.
			- On the other hand, more girls took part in the two remaining sports which both showed a difference of about 10 between the genders. As many as 50 girls preferred swimming in comparison to 40 girls for badminton.

			- These charts make comparisons among three kinds of music about their popularity between males and females and among four different age groups.
			- Overall, it is clear that males are more willing to buy music albums than females. Modern types of music are more popular among people under 45, while classical music is mainly purchased by those over 45.
			- In terms of the percentage of male and female buyers, we can see that the proportion of the former is higher than that of the latter in all kinds of music. To be more specific, the figures for buyers of pop and rock music are similar with 28% of males and 18% of females. Classical music is purchased by only 9% of men and 7% of women.
			- When it comes to the music preference of different age groups, it can be noticed that pop and rock music have extremely similar patterns of purchasing and are much more popular among younger buyers. Specifically, the proportion of music buyers aged 25-34 is the highest (32%), followed by that of people between 16 and 24 (30%) and that of buyers aged 35-44 (26%). By contrast, classical music is generally the least popular choice, mainly purchased by people over 45 with approximately 20%. The percentages of people aged 16-24 and 35-44 are minimal, at about 1% and 3% respectively.

			- The chart gives information about post-school qualifications in terms of the different levels of further education reached by men and women in Australia in 1999.
			- We can see immediately that there were substantial differences in the proportion of men and women at different levels. The biggest gender difference is at the lowest post-school level, where 90% of those who held a skilled vocational diploma were men, compared with only 10% of women. By contrast, more women held  undergraduate diplomas (70%) and marginally more women reached degree level (55%).
			- At the higher levels of education, men with postgraduate diplomas clearly outnumbered their female counterparts (70% and 30%, respectively), and also constituted 60% of Master's graduates.
			- Thus we can see that more men than women hold qualifications at the lower and higher levels of education, while more women reach undergraduate diploma level than men: The gender difference is smallest at the level of Bachelor's degree,

Specifically, 7% of the British were listening to radio at 6 a.m. This radio audience increased dramatically in the next 3 hours and peaked at nearly 30% at around 9 a.m. After that, there was a steady decrease until 2 a.m. of the next day when it reached a minimal level which remained constant for the next four hours.
				- As for TV viewers, after starting at around zero viewers at 6 am, the percentage of TV viewers in the UK was less than 7% until noon. After that, TV viewing began to gain popularity and it was at 1 p.m. that the percentage of TV audiences overtook that of radio listeners. The greatest growth can be seen between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m., during which time the audience more than tripled. After peaking at roughly 50%, it witnessed a rapid decline until 2 a.m. of the next day. Over the last four hours, very few people watched TV.

			- The bar charts show data about computer ownership, with a further classification by level of education, from 2002 to 2010.
			- A steady but significant rise can be seen in the percentage of the population that owned a computer over the period. Just over half the population owned computers in 2002, whereas by 2010 three out of four people had a home computer.
			- An analysis of the data by level of education shows that higher levels of education correspond to higher levels of computer ownership in both of those years. In 2002, only around 15% of those who did not finish high school had a computer but this figure had trebled by 2010. There were also considerable increases, of approximately 30 percentage points, for those with a high school diploma or an unfinished college education (reaching 65% and 85% respectively in 2010). However, graduates and postgraduates proved to have the greatest level of ownership in 2010, at 90% and 95% respectively, 20 percentage points higher than in 2002. 
			- The last decade has seen a substantial growth in computer ownership in general, and across all educational levels.

		- The line graph gives information about the consumption of electricity during a typical day in winter and summer respectively in England and the pie chart shows how the power is consumed.
		- Overall, the amount of electricity consumed during a day in winter is considerably larger than in summer. The peak demand for electricity in winter occurs at night, while in winter it appears at noon. Half of the electricity is used for heating.
		- In winter, the demand for electricity witnesses remarkable changes throughout 24 hours. Specifically, from midnight to about 1 p.m., the figure starts from 35,000 units and fluctuates widely ranging between 30,000 and 40,000 units. After reaching a plateau at 1 p.m., the amount of electricity consumed remains stable for 6 hours at 40, 000 before rising again and peaking at 10 p.m. The last two hours sees a remarkable fall in power demand. By contrast, the amount for summer changes much less significantly. With approximately 17,000 units consumed at midnight, it slightly decreases to about 12,000 at 9 a.m., after which it rises to 20, 000 at 1 p.m., reaching the peak of a day. Slight fluctuation can be seen in the demand for electricity during the rest time of a summer day.
		- The pie chart shows that over 50% of electricity is used to heat rooms and water, compared with only 17.5% for ovens, kettles and washing machines. The remaining 30% of power is equally consumed by lighting, TV and radio and vacuum cleansers, food mixers and electric tools.
