- a theory about the neural substrate of working memory storage: the same cortical regions responsible for perceptual processing are recruited for high-fidelity memory maintenance.
- “For example, working memory for faces is more impaired by other face distractors than by scene distractors [24]. A similar relationship is also present for low-level features (e.g., memory for spatial frequency is impaired by distractors differing in spatial frequency but not in orientation) [25,26]. This congruency effect has been used as behavioral evidence in support of a sensory recruitment model of working memory storage [27], which proposes that perception and memory draw upon a shared neural substrate (see ‘Sensory Recruitment’ section). This model predicts that competition over such a shared substrate and, consequently, behavioral interference, would be greatest when memoranda and distractors are most similar [28,29].”——[[2021_Lorenc_Distraction in Visua_KEY-XJP9XLT7]]])
