# Journal scope statement
_Psychological Bulletin_® publishes evidence syntheses of research in scientific psychology. Evidence syntheses seek to summarize past research by drawing overall conclusions from many separate investigations that address related or identical hypotheses. A research synthesis typically presents the authors' assessments:

-   of the state of knowledge concerning the relations of interest
-   of critical assessments of the strengths and weaknesses in past research
-   of important issues that research has left unresolved, thereby directing future research so it can yield a maximum amount of new information.

Evidence syntheses may take many forms (e.g., systematic reviews, meta-analyses, meta-reviews). Evidence syntheses that develop connections between areas of research are particularly valuable. No matter the form of review submitted, it is ideal that the methods to reach the conclusions are stated with precision and clarity, so that the contribution of the research synthesis can better be judged. Thus, transparency of methods is a priority. In some cases, rigorous and thorough qualitative reviews can be considered for publication. In all cases, expert peer reviewers assess the claims made in the review; submissions are expected to note limitations to the methods used to review evidence. Manuscripts dealing with topics at the interface of psychological sciences and society are welcome, as are evaluations of applied psychological therapies, programs, and interventions. Expository articles may be published if they are deemed transparent, accurate, broad, clear, and pertinent. Evidence syntheses should be submitted to _Psychological Bulletin_ even when they develop integrated theoretical statements. Yet, original theoretical articles should be submitted to _Psychological Review_, even when they include summaries of research. Methodological articles that previously were submitted to _Psychological Bulletin_ should now be submitted to _Psychological Methods_.

**Disclaimer:** APA and the editors of _Psychological Bulletin_® assume no responsibility for statements and opinions advanced by the authors of its articles.

## Masked review policy

The identities of authors will be withheld from reviewers and will be revealed after determining the final disposition of the manuscript only upon request and with the permission of the authors.

Authors are responsible for the preparation of manuscripts to permit masked review. Manuscripts submitted electronically should include all author names and affiliations, as well as the corresponding author's and co-authors' contact information, in the box labeled "cover letter," not in the manuscript file.

Every effort should be made to ensure that the manuscript itself contains no clues to the authors' identities, including deletion of easily identified self-references from the reference list as well as grant numbers, names of institutions providing IRB approval, self-citations (especially to recent publications), and links to online repositories for data, materials, code, or preregistrations (e.g., [Create a View-Only Link for a Project](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930333-Create-a-View-only-Link-for-a-Project)).

If an author believes that disclosing a personal identity is critical to receiving a fair review, such a request along with a justification should be made in the cover letter accompanying the manuscript.

Every effort should be made to ensure that the manuscript itself contains no clues to the authors' identities, including deletion of easily identified self-references from the reference list.

If an author feels that revealing his or her identity is critical to receiving a fair review, such a request along with its justification should be made in the cover letter accompanying the manuscript.

Please ensure that the final version for production includes a byline and full author note for typesetting.

## Journal Article Reporting Standards

Authors using meta-analytic methods must consult APA Style Meta-Analytic Reporting Standards (MARS). All systematic reviews must conform to standards of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ([PRISMA](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.n71); Page et al., 2020); as the title of this standard implies, PRISMA is a reporting standard and not a formal methodological quality standard. These standards offer ways to improve transparency in reporting to ensure that readers have the information necessary to evaluate the quality of the research, to facilitate collaboration, and to ease replication efforts. These and other contemporary guidelines focus on transparency in methods reporting, recommending descriptions of how the researchers’ own perspectives affected the study, as well as the contexts in which the research and analysis took place (for further details, see [editorial, Johnson, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1037/bul0000317)). For submissions using [quantitative](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/quantitative) and [mixed methods](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars/mixed-methods), authors must adhere to the [APA Style Journal Article Reporting Standards](https://apastyle.apa.org/jars) (JARS).

## Transparency and openness

APA endorses the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines developed by a community working group in conjunction with the Center for Open Science ([Nosek et al. 2015](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6242/1422.full)). Effective February 1, 2022, empirical research, including meta-analyses, submitted to _Psychological Bulletin_ will be required to report their work transparently as per journal policy.

Authors should include a subsection in the method section titled “Transparency and openness.” This subsection should detail the efforts the authors have made to comply with the TOP guidelines. For example:

We adhered to the MARS guidelines for meta-analytic reporting (Appelbaum et al., 2018). All meta-analytic data, analysis code, and research materials (including our coding scheme) are available at [stable link to repository]. Data were analyzed using R, version 4.0.0 (R Core Team, 2020) and the package _metafor_, version 3.0-2 (Viechtbauer, 2010). This review project was not preregistered.

We adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines for systematic reviews (Page et al., 2021). All data, analysis code, and research materials (including our coding scheme) are available at [stable link to repository]. Data were modeled using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 3 (Borenstein et al., 2013). This review project was preregistered at [stable link to repository].

We adhered to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines for systematic reviews (Page et al., 2021). All data and research materials (including our coding scheme) are available at [stable link to repository]. This review was not preregistered.

Links to preregistrations and data, code, and materials should also be included in the author note.

-   Citation: Level 2, Requirement—All data, program code, and other methods developed by others must be appropriately cited in the text and listed in the references section, as relevant.
-   Data Transparency: Level 2, Requirement—Article states whether the raw and/or processed data on which study conclusions are based are available and either where to access them or the legal or ethical reasons why they are not available (with approval from the editor in chief).
-   Analytic Methods (Code) Transparency: Level 2, Requirement—Article states whether computer code or syntax needed to reproduce analyses in an article is available and either where to access it or the legal or ethical reasons why it is not available.
-   Research Materials Transparency: Level 2, Requirement—Article states whether materials described in the method section are available and either where to access them or states the legal and/or ethical reasons why they are not available (with approval from the editor in chief).
-   Design and Analysis Transparency (Reporting Standards): Level 2, Requirement—Authors must comply with APA Style Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS and/or MARS). PRISMA 2020 is an acceptable replacement.
-   Study Preregistration: Level 2, Requirement—Article states whether the study design and (if applicable) hypotheses of any of the work reported was preregistered and, if so, where to access it. If the study was preregistered, access to the preregistration should be available at submission. Authors must submit a masked copy via stable link or supplemental material.
-   Analysis Plan Preregistration: Level 2, Requirement—Article states whether any of the work reported preregistered an analysis plan and, if so, where to access it. If the analysis plan was preregistered, access to the preregistration should be available at submission. Authors must submit a masked copy via stable link or supplemental material.
-   Replication: Level 1, Disclosure—The journal publishes replications only if they represent significant advances in psychological science and/or practice, consistent with the aims and scope of _Psychological Bulletin_.

### Data, materials, and code

Reviews that include quantitative analyses (e.g., meta-analyses) must state whether data and study materials (if these were created for the review, e.g., coding schemes) are available and where to access them. If they cannot be made available, authors must state the legal or ethical reasons why they are not available. [Recommended repositories](http://re3data.org/) include [APA’s repository](https://osf.io/meetings/apa/) on the Open Science Framework (OSF).

We require that authors who submit quantitative analyses supply their databases, codebook, and relevant scripts (e.g., so that reviewers can check analyses).

Authors may provide anonymized links to databases, codebook, and relevant scripts (instructions on [how to do so are available on OSF](https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930333-Create-a-View-only-Link-for-a-Project)); [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/) and [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/deposit/) also offer services for posting replication data files). Should the manuscript be published, these links (now made non-anonymized) must be included in the author note. Authors should be alert to use registries that permit anonymizing contributors’ names (to maintain the journal’s double-masked reviewing strategy). As of December 2021, PROSPERO does not offer this feature; _Bulletin_ submissions that have been registered on PROSPERO can be attach the registration details as an appendix, omitting author names and the registration number.

Authors must make sure to remove authorship information (e.g., names, affiliations) from these files, in order to help maintain the integrity of the double-masked review process. Similarly, linked webpage and materials available there should not reveal the authors' identities. The database must include all variables reported in the manuscript.

In both the author note and at the end of the method section, specify whether and where the data and material will be available or note the legal or ethical reasons for not doing so. For submissions with quantitative or simulation analytic methods, state in the transparency and openness sub-section whether the study analysis code is available, and, if so, where to access it. For example:

All data for this project, along with relevant code and codebooks, have been made publicly available at the [repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].

The code behind this analysis/simulation has been made publicly available at the [repository name] and can be accessed at [persistent URL or DOI].

### Preregistration of studies and analysis plans

Preregistration of studies and specific hypotheses are often a useful tool for making strong theoretical claims. Likewise, preregistration of analysis plans can be useful for distinguishing confirmatory and exploratory analyses. We encourage investigators to preregister their studies and analysis plans prior to conducting the research (e.g., [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) or the [Preregistration for Quantitative Research in Psychology](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlp5GN-HXrtrjCdjE28f_3tT6RiwhQO2vVeOZGOaFsQ/edit#gid=0) template) via a publicly accessible registry system (e.g., [OSF](https://osf.io/prereg/), ClinicalTrials.gov, or other trial registries in the WHO Registry Network).

Articles must state whether or not any work was preregistered and, if so, where to access the preregistration. If reviews were pre-registered as protocols or if quantitative analyses were pre-registered, include the registry links in the method section and the author note. Preregistrations must be available to reviewers; authors may submit a masked copy via stable link or supplemental material. Links in the method section (transparency and openness sub-section) and the author note should be replaced with an identifiable copy on acceptance. For example:

_For a systematic review_: This review’s protocol was pre-registered at [stable link to protocol]. We followed the PRISMA-P checklist when preparing the protocol, and we followed PRISMA reporting guidelines for the final report.

_For a systematic review with meta-analysis:_ This review’s protocol was pre-registered at [stable link to protocol]. We followed the PRISMA-P checklist when preparing the protocol, and we followed PRISMA reporting guidelines for the final report. The meta-analytic analysis plan is at [stable link]. The meta-analytic data are shared at [stable link to repository].

_For a meta-analysis that extends a previous review:_ This review replicates and extends [citation to previous review]. Its protocol was pre-registered at [stable link to protocol]. We followed the PRISMA-P checklist when preparing the protocol, and we followed PRISMA reporting guidelines for the final report. The meta-analytic analysis plan is at [stable link]. The meta-analytic data are shared at [stable link to repository].

_For an unregistered review_: This review was not pre-registered. We followed PRISMA reporting guidelines for the final report.

## Policy on commentaries

_Psychological Bulletin_ traditionally publishes commentaries that are requested by the action editor in light of issues that arise during the review. These commentaries are brief, with the length set by the action editor but never exceeding half of the length of the original article.

The authors of the target article are then invited to write a response. The length of the response is also determined by the action editor and cannot exceed half of the length of the individual commentary/ies.

Both commentaries and responses have a strict timeline set by the action editor, which is typically one month. The response from the author/s of the target article ends the discussion in the context of _Psychological Bulletin_. After that point, authors are encouraged to submit related manuscripts to other scientific outlets.

Commentaries are not accepted for articles that are already in print.

Unsolicited commentaries may be submitted by authors only while accepted target articles are disseminated online. If submitted later, authors must present a strong rationale for considering a comment beyond the standard time frame. Such requests, however, are rarely granted, and authors should consider other outlets for unsolicited commentaries. Unsolicited commentaries are subject to the regular process of preliminary editorial review after which a commentary, if deemed appropriate, may be sent out for external peer review.

No commentaries are published without external review.

## Manuscript preparation

Prepare manuscripts according to the _Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association_ using the 7th edition. Manuscripts may be copyedited for bias-free language (see Chapter 5 of the _Publication Manual_). [APA Style and Grammar Guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines?_ga=2.108621957.62505448.1611587229-1146984327.1584032077&_gac=1.60264799.1610575983.Cj0KCQiA0fr_BRDaARIsAABw4EvuRpQd5ff159C0LIBvKTktJUIeEjl7uMbrD1RjULX63J2Qc1bJoEIaAsdnEALw_wcB) for the 7th edition are available.

Review APA's [Journal Manuscript Preparation Guidelines](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/manuscript-submission-guidelines) before submitting your article.

Double-space all copy. Other formatting instructions, as well as instructions on preparing tables, figures, references, metrics, and abstracts, appear in the _Manual_. Additional guidance on APA Style is available on the [APA Style website](https://apastyle.apa.org/).

Below are additional instructions regarding the preparation of display equations, computer code, and tables.

### Display equations

For equations, use MathType (third-party software) or Equation Editor (built into Word since 2007). Earlier versions of equation support in Word are converted to low-resolution graphics when they enter the production process and must be rekeyed by the typesetter, which may introduce errors. [Review the instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/write-an-equation-or-formula-1d01cabc-ceb1-458d-bc70-7f9737722702) for how to use Word’s equation editor.

If you have an equation that has already been produced using Microsoft Word 2007 or 2010 and you have access to the full version of MathType 6.5 or later, you can convert this equation to MathType by clicking on MathType Insert Equation. Copy the equation from Microsoft Word and paste it into the MathType box. Verify that your equation is correct, click File, and then click Update. Your equation has now been inserted into your Word file as a MathType Equation.

### Computer code

Because altering computer code in any way (e.g., indents, line spacing, line breaks, page breaks) during the typesetting process could alter its meaning, we treat computer code differently from the rest of your article in our production process. To that end, we request separate files for computer code.

#### In online supplemental material

We request that runnable source code be included as supplemental material to the article. For more information, visit [Supplementing Your Article With Online Material](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/supplemental-material).

#### In the text of the article

If you would like to include code in the text of your published manuscript, please submit a separate file with your code exactly as you want it to appear, using Courier New font with a type size of 8 points. We will make an image of each segment of code in your article that exceeds 40 characters in length. (Shorter snippets of code that appear in text will be typeset in Courier New and run in with the rest of the text.) If an appendix contains a mix of code and explanatory text, please submit a file that contains the entire appendix, with the code keyed in 8-point Courier New.

### Tables

Use Word's insert table function when you create tables. Using spaces or tabs in your table will create problems when the table is typeset and may result in errors.

## Academic writing and English language editing services

Authors who feel that their manuscript may benefit from additional academic writing or language editing support prior to submission are encouraged to seek out such services at their host institutions, engage with colleagues and subject matter experts, and/or consider several [vendors that offer discounts to APA authors](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/editing-services).

Please note that APA does not endorse or take responsibility for the service providers listed. It is strictly a referral service.

Use of such service is not mandatory for publication in an APA journal. Use of one or more of these services does not guarantee selection for peer review, manuscript acceptance, or preference for publication in any APA journal.

## Submitting supplemental materials

APA can place supplemental materials online, available via the published article in the PsycArticles® database. Please see [Supplementing Your Article With Online Material](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/supplemental-material) for more details.

## Abstract and keywords

All manuscripts must include an abstract containing a maximum of 250 words typed on a separate page. After the abstract, please supply up to five keywords or brief phrases.

## Public significance statements

Authors submitting manuscripts to _Psychological Bulletin_ are required to provide two to three brief sentences regarding the relevance or public health significance of the study or meta-analysis described in their manuscript.

This description should be included within the manuscript on the abstract/keywords page.

It should be written in language that is easily understood by both professionals and members of the lay public.

Examples:

-   "This meta-analytic review strongly suggests that (description of a given psychosocial treatment) is an effective treatment for anxiety, but only if it is of mild to moderate severity. For persons with severe anxiety, additional treatments may be necessary."
-   "This systematic review indicates that personality changes following psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. The changes are small and persist for (description of time in months or years)"
-   "This meta-analytic review reveals a small to moderate effect of incidentally presenting words (e.g., as part of a game) on the actual actions of the recipients following priming. These effects are stronger when recipients of the primes are likely to value the behavior."

To be maximally useful, these statements of public significance should not simply be sentences lifted directly from the manuscript.

This statement supports efforts to increase the dissemination and usage of research findings by larger and more diverse audiences. In addition, they should be able to be translated into media-appropriate statements for use in press releases and on social media.

Authors may refer to the [Guidance for Translational Abstracts and Public Significance Statements](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/translational-messages) page for help writing their statement.

Prior to final acceptance and publication, all public significance statements will be carefully reviewed to make sure they meet these standards. Authors will be expected to revise statements as necessary.

## Figures

Graphics files are welcome if supplied as Tiff or EPS files. Multipanel figures (i.e., figures with parts labeled a, b, c, d, etc.) should be assembled into one file.

The minimum line weight for line art is 0.5 point for optimal printing.

For more information about acceptable resolutions, fonts, sizing, and other figure issues, [please see the general guidelines](https://www.kwglobal.com/digital-art-support).

When possible, please place symbol legends below the figure instead of to the side.

APA offers authors the option to publish their figures online in color without the costs associated with print publication of color figures.

The same caption will appear on both the online (color) and print (black and white) versions. To ensure that the figure can be understood in both formats, authors should add alternative wording (e.g., "the red (dark gray) bars represent") as needed.

For authors who prefer their figures to be published in color both in print and online, original color figures can be printed in color at the editor's and publisher's discretion provided the author agrees to pay:

-   $900 for one figure
-   An additional $600 for the second figure
-   An additional $450 for each subsequent figure

## Permissions

Authors of accepted papers must obtain and provide to the editor on final acceptance all necessary permissions to reproduce in print and electronic form any copyrighted work, including test materials (or portions thereof), photographs, and other graphic images (including those used as stimuli in experiments).

On advice of counsel, APA may decline to publish any image whose copyright status is unknown.

## Publication policies

APA policy prohibits an author from submitting the same manuscript for concurrent consideration by two or more publications.

See also [APA Journals® Internet Posting Guidelines](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/internet-posting-guidelines).

APA requires authors to reveal any possible conflict of interest in the conduct and reporting of research (e.g., financial interests in a test or procedure, funding by pharmaceutical companies for drug research).

-   [Download Disclosure of Interests Form (PDF, 38KB)](https://www.apa.org/pubs/authors/disclosure-of-interests.pdf)

In light of changing patterns of scientific knowledge dissemination, APA requires authors to provide information on prior dissemination of the data and narrative interpretations of the data/research appearing in the manuscript (e.g., if some or all were presented at a conference or meeting, posted on a listserv, shared on a website, including academic social networks like ResearchGate, etc.). This information (2–4 sentences) must be provided as part of the author note.

_Psychological Bulletin_ does not accept submissions which have appeared online as preprints, at this time.

Authors of accepted manuscripts are required to transfer the copyright to APA.

## Ethical Principles

It is a violation of APA Ethical Principles to publish "as original data, data that have been previously published" (Standard 8.13).

In addition, APA Ethical Principles specify that "after research results are published, psychologists do not withhold the data on which their conclusions are based from other competent professionals who seek to verify the substantive claims through reanalysis and who intend to use such data only for that purpose, provided that the confidentiality of the participants can be protected and unless legal rights concerning proprietary data preclude their release" (Standard 8.14).

APA expects authors to adhere to these standards. Specifically, APA expects authors to have their data available throughout the editorial review process and for at least 5 years after the date of publication.

Authors are required to state in writing that they have complied with APA ethical standards in the treatment of their sample, human or animal, or to describe the details of treatment.
