		- The 21st century has seen a large number of changes that are beyond our wildest expectations. 
			- One of these advances is the rapid development of communications technology. 
				- The advantages of convenience and high efficiency brought by digital communication are obvious, but I do not think that everyone has access to these benefits.
		- Digital forms of communication enable many people, mainly including students, families as well as entrepreneurs, to reap the maximum benefits. From an educational perspective, learning can be incredibly efficient and effective, as students having the internet connection can virtually solve all their puzzles by browsing teaching websites or asking for help from teachers simultaneously. Internet-based communication also contributes positively to strengthening family relationships and increasing closeness between family members. For example, students who attend boarding schools or study abroad are able to keep in daily contact easily with parents by sending greeting messages or camera chatting. What is more, companies can be run at a much lower cost because the internet and computers help to expand business cheaply and because information technology allows employees to work at home, which saves most of the rents for office space.
		- However, I would argue that the benefits of information and communication technology are restricted to certain groups of users. In other words, some people, particularly the old and the poor, are not beneficiaries of modern ways of communication. With regard to the former, a large percentage of elderly people are unable and reluctant to adapt to new technology, which means that they barely enjoy the convenience and fun brought by the devices. As for people living in extreme poverty, mobile phones, computers and any other electronic devices are luxuries. All web-based activities mean nothing to them, neither making them relaxed nor providing them with career opportunities.
		- In conclusion, I agree with the idea that technological advances in information and communication have only brought benefits to a certain group of people, even though it is a large group.
