	- Systematic and comprehensive searches of the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were performed in December 2020 according to the PRISMA guidelines (Shamseer et al., 2015). 【[[Feng et al., 2021]]】
	- To identify relevant published articles, a multistep search strategy was employed. Literature scoping searches were initially conducted toidentify keywords and search terms relevant to the hippocampus and diet. Two electronic databases (Web of Science and PsychINFO) were systematically searched between August 2019 and December 2019 utilising the previously identified keywords and search terms (see Supplementary materials for full list). This occurred without restriction on the publication period. The reference lists of all articles identified for inclusion, as well as any review articles uncovered through the full systematic search, were manually searched for other relevant published papers. The full search and screening protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020157105).【[[Taylor et al., 2021]]】
