	- “We propose that the CDA tracks how much information passes through the gate, whereas the PD reflects the gate itself.”
	- “Previous research has shown that PD amplitude scales with the number of items that were blocked from entering WM (Feldmann-Wüstefeld et al. 2019).”
	- “Therefore, PD amplitude may reflect how firmly the WM gate was closed. Conversely, the CDA could reflect how much information is encoded into WM, with relevant information more likely to pass through the gate.”

			- “For example, when target identity is correctly reported in a visual search task, a concurrently presented salient distractor elicits a pronounced PD component, indicative of active suppression (Feldmann-Wüstefeld et al. 2020).”
			- “Conversely, when the distractor identity is erroneously reported, distractors elicit a CDA and a less pronounced PD, suggesting that the distractor was encoded into WM.”
