the no ac in the dorms in the summer i

0:02

heard about that

0:03

i probably might be that's pretty bad

0:04

some people are really chill and then

0:06

there are

0:06

obviously like the rich people group at

0:09

harvard everyone around me is kind of

0:10

insane

0:11

and i'm just kind of chilling in my room

0:13

like trying to keep up with school

0:16

[Music]

0:39

i keep

0:46

[Music]

0:53

what's up guys today we're here in

0:55

boston as you probably saw from the

0:57

intro i've actually been in the us for

0:59

about a week now but

1:00

i was in new york city and decided not

1:02

to film while i was there since i was

1:03

pretty busy if you're new to the channel

1:05

my name is erin and i make

1:06

student-related videos

1:07

about technology college life

1:10

productivity and

1:11

basically anything that's related to

1:12

students today we're going to harvard

1:14

university to see if we can find some

1:15

students to interview

1:16

and get their advice on applying to

1:18

colleges and just school and life in

1:19

general

1:20

so stick around if you're interested in

1:21

seeing more of that

1:27

[Music]

1:33

1:35

study and your major hi

1:37

i'm eliana i'm a rising sophomore so

1:39

1:43

history and literature or

1:44

sociology i'm angela also class of 24

1:49

so rising sophomore and probably

1:51

studying computer science and statistics

1:53

i'm garrison manor a rising junior in

1:55

pre-med stem cell bio

1:57

and i'm alex washington i'm a rising

1:59

junior as well and i'm sociology with

2:01

the minor heart i'm tyler

2:02

i am class of 24s a rising sophomore and

2:06

my major is molecular biology and then

2:09

i'm jordan

2:10

i'm also class of 24 and my

2:12

concentration is neuroscience

2:13

i'm versable and i'm a junior at harvard

2:16

and i'm studying biomedical engineering

2:18

i'm kittist i am a junior and i'm

2:22

studying computer science

2:23

so first question is what is your

2:25

favorite and least favorite thing about

2:27

harvard

2:30

for me my favorite thing uh definitely

2:32

to be the location

2:34

really close to a bunch of other schools

2:35

boston college boston tufts

2:37

um social scene's cool kids here are

2:39

cool so that's definitely my favorite

2:41

thing

2:41

uh my favorite thing will probably be

2:43

the people yeah

2:44

it's just like harvard it's unique place

2:46

a lot of unique people

2:47

um a lot of crazy smart people so

2:50

definitely got to say to people for sure

2:52

i'd say my favorite thing would be just

2:54

like the amount of resources that are

2:55

available to me

2:56

and it just goes beyond like the

2:59

textbook and i can actually practice

3:00

what i'm learning in labs or with

3:02

professors and stuff um also the

3:05

community of the teaching staff

3:07

has been great so far and they're super

3:09

supportive

3:10

my favorite thing about harvard i'm

3:12

pretty sure you've heard us before it's

3:13

the people

3:14

yeah um you're introduced to a diverse

3:18

class i'm international i'm from

3:21

ethiopia and

3:23

i get to meet people from all from all

3:26

over the world

3:27

interested in different things and also

3:29

like bursa said

3:31

i might one of my favorite things about

3:33

harvard is the

3:34

how supportive the teaching staff is i

3:36

think it's like a very common answer but

3:38

the community

3:39

and the people here i think they really

3:41

make and shape a lot of your experiences

3:44

in college we haven't really experienced

3:46

the real like harvard experience yet

3:47

because like

3:48

things were virtual i think the biggest

3:50

thing was like community for me like the

3:52

people i've met just even in the dorms

3:53

like in my entryway i think that was

3:55

like

3:55

um the most memorable and the best part

3:57

so far my favorite thing was just like

3:59

meeting new people

4:00

like everyone here is so different but

4:02

like they're all like

4:03

passionate about their own thing and so

4:05

like it's really

4:06

interesting to get to talk to them

4:08

probably like the architecture of

4:09

harvard like it's just really cool like

4:11

walking in and seeing everything

4:12

like i don't know you just see it online

4:14

yeah and then you get to like come and

4:16

experience it

4:17

and least favorite or least favorite

4:20

i know i just talked about the location

4:22

but the cold the weather the weather in

4:23

the winter gets pretty bad that's

4:24

probably my least favorite thing

4:26

okay yeah yeah honestly i'm gonna say

4:28

something close to weather too

4:30

that no ac in the dorms in the summer i

4:32

heard about that

4:33

probably my least favorite that's pretty

4:34

bad

4:36

uh that's stuff yeah um i think i have

4:40

one

4:41

i don't think it's particular to harvard

4:43

but um

4:44

maybe like hyper productivity and just

4:46

like the

4:47

i don't know as a student you kind of

4:49

feel the need to be doing something at

4:51

all times um

4:52

even when you want to take a break and

4:54

steps i'll just

4:56

suck in that okay okay least favorite

4:58

thing is probably

4:59

feeling like you don't have the capacity

5:01

to do as much as you want

5:02

um and always feeling like you don't

5:04

have enough time to spend with the

5:06

people

5:06

you love or to like pursue other things

5:09

so just like always feeling like

5:11

not enough time i think that's

5:12

definitely the worst part like not

5:14

having the time but i was like feeling

5:16

like i should be doing more

5:17

because everyone around me is kind of

5:18

insane and i'm just kind of chilling in

5:20

my room like trying to keep

5:21

up with school so i think that's a

5:23

little overwhelming sometimes but like

5:25

that definitely settled in as time

5:27

my least favorite thing is that none of

5:28

the dorms really have air conditioning

5:30

and it's the summer time

5:31

actually yeah i second that okay so next

5:33

question is what is something you wish

5:34

you knew before coming to harvard

5:39

uh you go first

5:42

probably just like how the culture is

5:44

like there's a lot of perceptions and uh

5:47

stuff about harvard like stereotypes but

5:48

the culture here is like pretty cool

5:50

so i would say yeah yeah i would have to

5:52

agree i thought that people would be

5:53

like oh

5:55

like snobby and things like that but

5:56

like alex said you know people here are

5:58

pretty cool

5:58

probably that life moves a lot faster

6:02

than you expect

6:03

especially once you come to college like

6:05

when you're in high school life is a lot

6:06

more like slow pace than you realize and

6:08

you get

6:09

like you take a lot of things for

6:10

granted including like time with family

6:12

time with people at home um so i think

6:14

just like really savoring every moment

6:16

you have

6:17

and then coming into college with that

6:18

mindset especially because of college

6:19

like you only have four years

6:20

it's a very unique like stage of life

6:22

coming into harvard i was kind of

6:25

worried that the people around me would

6:27

be a little

6:28

you know competitive kind of snakey you

6:30

know

6:32

but it's really not like that i'm i'm

6:34

not just saying it's actually really not

6:35

like that i think

6:36

or maybe i just got lucky with like the

6:39

circle i'm in but everyone's really

6:40

supportive like everyone works together

6:42

like they try to help

6:43

help you everyone wants to do well

6:45

together um

6:46

it's just a really supportive warm

6:47

community i wish i would have known like

6:49

how

6:50

important it is to find something that

6:51

you're really really passionate about

6:53

i didn't really like start getting

6:54

interested in mainly i got like

6:56

interested in languages and stuff

6:57

my senior year and junior year and so i

6:59

found like a lot of opportunities once

7:01

they like dialed in on that

7:02

concept yeah it's much easier to um

7:05

stand out when you really have like

7:07

something you're like really all in

7:10

on like you're really passionate about

7:12

it and

7:14

sometimes you don't know what that is in

7:16

high school yet but um

7:18

it's really good to have like one or two

7:19

things that um

7:21

really like motivates you don't be

7:23

scared to talk to people that would be

7:25

the biggest thing like whether

7:27

professors tas or just

7:29

other students just to reach out people

7:32

are just super supportive here and that

7:34

would

7:35

probably be my number one advice my

7:36

advice would be that it's okay to be

7:38

uncomfortable

7:40

you find growth and at times where

7:43

you're not the most comfortable

7:44

yeah um and yeah i wish i knew that

7:47

coming in as a freshman

7:48

yeah okay what is one piece of advice

7:50

that you would give to students who are

7:52

looking to apply to harvard

7:54

okay i will go first so when i was in

7:56

high school playing harvard

7:58

i remember i was really stressed because

7:59

i had no idea like what i was supposed

8:00

to do like what harvard was looking for

8:03

and i think i was trying to like strive

8:05

to find this formula for like

8:07

extracurriculars i need to do like test

8:08

scores and all that stuff and i would

8:09

like stress myself out but i realized

8:11

like after coming here like everybody is

8:13

so different

8:14

like i have not met like two people who

8:16

are like everyone has their own story

8:18

and i think

8:19

just like highlighting that in your

8:20

application bringing that out like

8:22

showing the admissions officers who you

8:23

are like why you stand out why you're

8:24

different it doesn't have to be

8:26

like i'm smarter than everybody else i'm

8:28

good at this one thing it's just

8:29

even if it's just like your personal

8:31

like what makes you stand out i think

8:32

just focusing on that and just being

8:34

really honest in your application not

8:35

trying to fake it

8:36

or like shape it in any like artificial

8:38

way just take your time with it like

8:40

start early and take a long time to

8:42

really

8:43

reflect on like your life so far and who

8:45

you are as a person

8:47

and your experiences and yeah just say

8:48

stay true to yourself

8:50

i would say that don't try to go too far

8:53

they are very diverse in the application

8:55

process and their acceptances

8:57

so somebody could be in all these clubs

8:59

and have the gpa a ct

9:01

and it's not really going to matter so

9:02

try to you know just be yourself don't

9:04

reach too far

9:05

but also you know try to have like a

9:08

very broad range of you know

9:09

characteristics that apply to you

9:11

yeah i would say probably be unique um

9:13

you know it's a lot of kids that are

9:15

smart a lot of kids that get good grades

9:16

on the att

9:17

whatever but like have something like

9:19

you know special to you

9:20

that makes you different and makes you

9:22

stand out from like other applicants

9:24

to start early i started late and it was

9:26

quite stressful

9:27

but start early with your applications

9:29

try to support

9:30

your friends as well who are also

9:32

applying don't be

9:34

i don't know don't be too competitive at

9:36

the end of the day

9:37

um the whole application process is not

9:40

really in your hands

9:42

there's a there's some element of luck

9:44

in it so

9:45

don't be too stressful support each

9:47

other um

9:49

that's it make sure you have your

9:51

priorities in order

9:53

um just because someone thinks that

9:55

harvard is the best school for

9:57

like them doesn't necessarily mean it's

9:59

the best food for you

10:00

um even though that's like easier like

10:03

to say because it's like you know it's a

10:04

pretty prestigious

10:05

uh university but just making sure that

10:08

what

10:09

you have everything you want in a co in

10:11

a college program before you apply

10:13

would probably be my number one thing

10:15

you got to love to learn

10:16

i guess um i mean i feel like that's the

10:19

only way that you're gonna

10:20

succeed like past high school and like

10:23

actually enjoy your college experience

10:25

um and i feel like like i said like a

10:27

way to do that is find something you're

10:28

actually passionate about but like you

10:29

gotta love learning okay so last

10:32

question

10:33

is what is a common stereotype about

10:35

harvard that you found to be true

10:36

or false since you've come here i think

10:39

for me

10:40

the thing she already mentioned um a

10:43

little bit about like the

10:43

competitiveness

10:44

i think that was like one of the reasons

10:46

why i was hesitant about committing was

10:48

just worrying that

10:49

like my my personality is like being on

10:51

the introverted side wouldn't fit in

10:52

with like everyone who's like

10:53

extroverted

10:54

and really outgoing um but i think

10:57

that's the biggest misconception that

10:58

i've encountered so far

11:00

um have found a very like loving group

11:03

of friends

11:04

um who like i now call my family so

11:07

yeah that's been very very something i'm

11:09

very grateful for

11:11

yeah same thing it's just harvard is

11:14

not as scary and mean and intimidating

11:17

as people

11:18

think yeah like we seriously really love

11:21

people

11:21

yeah and regular professors regular

11:23

teachers

11:24

so we're athletes like the stereotype

11:26

about the athletes is that we're all

11:27

dumb

11:28

like you know we just got in because of

11:29

sports so i definitely say that's the

11:31

stereotype because

11:32

all of us you know have to take the same

11:33

classes do all the same work so i feel

11:35

like

11:36

that's a that's a bad stereotype you

11:38

know for the athletes up here

11:39

yeah and uh i don't know like this rumor

11:42

was like spread around in my high school

11:44

in bama but like people were saying you

11:45

had to wear suits every day to class

11:47

that's definitely like not true so yeah

11:50

i thought everyone was geeky like before

11:53

coming in

11:54

but that was not true um there's

11:57

not everyone is that geeky even though

12:00

um

12:01

we can geek out on certain stuff certain

12:03

times

12:05

there's a lot of fun not as much as

12:08

other colleges i'd admit but

12:10

um it's still fun coming in i would

12:13

think people would be like

12:14

really cutthroat and competitive um but

12:16

that's really not the case when you come

12:18

here everyone's doing their own thing

12:20

um and like sometimes it's sort of

12:23

aspirational

12:24

as well because you see people like

12:25

doing cool stuff and you're like oh my

12:27

gosh i actually want to try that too

12:28

um and it's kind of like that culture

12:30

versus like

12:32

okay i'm gonna take that one spot that's

12:33

left in this team of researchers

12:35

whatever you know um

12:36

i think that's probably something that

12:38

was pleasantly surprising

12:39

i'm gonna start with the false one just

12:41

because that's easier i think people

12:42

think that it's

12:43

really cutthroat here but like it just

12:46

kind of

12:46

depends on what group you get in with

12:49

like some people are really chill and

12:50

then there are

12:51

obviously like groups of students that

12:53

are like way more focused on grades and

12:56

like

12:56

being like the top of the class an

12:58

obvious true one is there are

13:00

insanely smart people that attend this

13:02

school and like you'll just be at lunch

13:04

and then they'll be talking about how

13:05

they're like solving some like world

13:06

crisis and you'll be like oh that's cool

13:09

yeah but yeah that's definitely a true

13:10

one there definitely is like

13:13

a preppy or like um kind of like

13:16

you know like the rich people group at

13:18

harvard yeah like that like

13:20

image that everyone here is super

13:21

entitled and privileged so like yeah

13:23

there's like a bunch of

13:24

first-gen people and like um

13:27

it's somewhat meritocratic but there is

13:30

also

13:30

that group of people that like got here

13:32

through money and privilege

13:34

and sometimes you don't want to really

13:37

like interact with those kind of people

13:49

[Music]

13:58

okay
