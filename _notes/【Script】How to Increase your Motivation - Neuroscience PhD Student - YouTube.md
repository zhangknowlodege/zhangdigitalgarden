so one of my favorite movie makers is

Miyazaki from the famous Studio Ghibli

movies he created Spirited Away My

Neighbor Totoro and house Moving Castle

a few years ago a documentary came out

that recorded his insanely dedicated

working style the Kingdom of Dreams and

madness he rises at 6am each morning and

exercises and then takes his coffee and

arrives at Studio Ghibli by 9 am sharp

working Saturdays and holidays too <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">he

draws all of the film's initial

storyboard by himself by hand which is

something almost none of the other big

animators do</mark> several times after the

completion of one of his films Miyazaki

would suggest that the studio be shot

down and all his stuff be fired no one

was ever sure if he was just kidding he

is known for his endless amount of

determination and motivation to Everyday

get up and work on some of the most

beautiful films but how does he do it

and what is the source of his motivation

and that is the topic that I want to

dive into today and I want to teach you

about Neuroscience of motivation and

everything to optimize your motivation

for the certain goals that you want to

achieve so hi I'm shallots a second year

PhD student in computational

neuroscience and today we will discuss

the Neuroscience of motivation or the

will and this is a follow-up video of a

previous video that I made about the way

or how to achieve your goals so also

check that one out if you haven't seen

it but today we will really dive deep

into how to emote yourself and what is

the Neuroscience behind motivation and I

will give you at the end of this video

three tools that are steeped in

Neuroscience such that you may optimize

for motivation in your daily life so

let's get straight into it so in our

brain different parts of our brain

regulate reward prediction we have the

orbital frontal cortex the anterior

singlet and the basal lateral amygdala

and all of these have been shown to be

correlated with reward prediction error

but as I've said in Neuroscience

nowadays people believe that it's more a

network type of connection between the

different areas of our brain that

usually accounts for higher level types

of behavior but what it comes down to in

the end is a cost versus benefit type of

analysis that your brain makes when it

looks at a certain goal and based on

this cost versus benefits it decides if

it's motivated enough to do that so

let's dive into this cost versus benefit

analysis so we have our costs which are

usually effort time discomfort pain Etc

and we have the benefits which are

potential prices meeting our

psychological and physiological needs

and somewhere in between these two we

decide our motivation to strive forward

towards our goals and usually these

costs and benefits depend on three types

of things so we have our physiological

State our environment and our our past

history so if we break it down into

these three components we can kind of

play around with these three components

and optimize for these such that our

cost benefit analysis is positive

towards the benefits and we increase our

motivation so one of the goals this

semester for me is to get a little bit

better at French I used to be quite good

at French when I lived in France but I

haven't really been for the past two

years so I really want to increase my

level and probably be able to read a

full book in French so I will walk you

through the three topics that I talked

about to see how I optimize for them to

really allow for my goal to get better

in French to come real and hopefully as

I walk you through you will also get

some tips and some tools such that you

can also optimize for the goals that you

want to achieve so for motivation one of

the main components is our physiological

state so that's how rested we are in

which part of our <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">circadian rhythm </mark>we

are how much stress we had have we eaten

and all these type of factors combined

to decide how we feel usually and what

state our body is in and you probably

know that if you haven't rested properly

it's just really hard to focus on a

certain type of task so if you look at

right now your physiological stage you

close your eyes and you just kind of

feel where you're at decide if you think

that your body is at a good place right

now and if your physiological State

isn't really at the place that you want

it the thing that people in Neuroscience

or that's grounded in the Neuroscience

of motivation and reinforcement learning

is to start Behavior change with modest

goals and rewards even the smallest

steps towards them new behaviors emerge

slowly because they usually work against

the power of Prior reinforcement so

that's to say that if we want to

introduce new healthy habits to increase

the well-being of our physiological

State we kind of have to introduce them

slowly and carefully so for example if

you want to be a little bit better

rested it's good to go to bed for

example 15 minutes earlier and not

immediately decide that today I'm gonna

sleep at nine o'clock and I'm gonna wake

up at five because the probability of

you doing that based on your prior

reinforcement learning is just very low

and another thing I want to talk about

is a little bit like deep rest the

concept of deep rest so you've probably

heard the concept of deep work but I

think something that we don't think

about enough is deep rest so we have

these kind of shallow rest moments

throughout our week for example really

good meal or taking having a talk with a

friend but I think it's also good to

plan throughout your week one day where

you really have really focus on

depressed and that is for example really

disconnecting from the internet from

your phone taking a long walk out in

nature or having a really deep good

conversation with a friend and I think

this is as opposed to these sporadic

moments that we have of relaxation which

is like watching a YouTube video or

having a drink for example and I think

these are usually more coping strategies

these are not really these deep rest

moments so when you look at your week

try to for example in the weekend pick

one day where you really try to

disconnect from everything and the

second topic that we can play with when

we look at motivation is our environment

so when we think of our environment It's

usually the availability of the goal

that decides if we pursue the goal so

for example if you walk past a

restaurant and you're a little bit

hungry the chances of you being

motivated to go to that restaurant and

order a delicious meal increase

significantly and that's why when you

think of your goals and your motivation

it's good to optimize your environment

such that it really allows you to

achieve your goals quite easily so for

example you can decide in your room to

just have one place where you only do

work so every time you want to relax you

leave that place and every time you want

to work you go towards that place and

that way at a certain point your brain

kind of starts identifying that place

with work and at a certain point you

will also start to notice that as soon

as you enter that place you kind of go

into this work mode mindset another

topic that you can play with when you

think of your environment is actually

time so the timing of day or the time

when you do something is part of our

temporal environment I would say so our

temporal environment can for example be

that you every morning you do an hour of

French in my case and that way when that

hour arrives you kind of signify to your

brain ah it's French time so right now I

plan my hour of French in the weekend

and the way I'm doing it is with this

language school linguda it's an online

Language School who was kindly enough to

also sponsor this video so I used to be

as I said quite good at French Bob

because I don't really have people to

practice with it's becoming really hard

for me and that's why I really like

linguda as you can see they have these

kind of chapters and you can see your

progress so I'm still not very far but

when I book a class right now I'm

learning about the difference and I'm

learning a little bit all about

immigration which I think is a really

interesting topic and I first personally

really believe that the fastest way to

learn a language is to speak with a

native speaker and in the case of

linguda all their teachers are native

speakers so I hope you joined this

language learning Challenge and perhaps

pick an hour in the weekend to really

optimize for your language learning and

if you're super motivated linguda also

has this amazing language prints so the

linguda language print is a two-month

intensive challenge that requires

students to register at least for 15 or

30 lessons a month and if students take

part in every lesson they can receive 50

to 100 cashback so that means that it

would be totally free if you're

extremely motivated so if you are trying

to learn a language I think this is a

really cool challenge to do and I highly

recommend signing up you can use the

link down in the description below or

just check linguda out for yourself so

the last thing you can optimize for is

your narrative or your history and this

is a little bit more difficult because

it is usually our experiences of the

goal or our responses to a stimuli and

we cannot really change those because

these are usually just inherent to us

but we can play around a little bit with

the goals that we pick so it has been

written that a behavior will hold

greater subjective value to the degree

that it relates to one's core values and

sense of self identity linked goals are

more likely to be successful than

identity irrelevant or identity counter

ones and this really just boils down to

really thinking about what are your core

values and do the goals that you've

picked actually match your core values

because I sometimes see that people are

really unmotivated to do certain work or

certain type of behavior and it usually

boils down to that they don't really

relate to that goal so for example for

me my core values are wisdom creativity

and health slash happiness so usually

when I pick my goals I do try to think

about do these goals actually align with

the type of values that I want to pursue

in my life so if you are still not sure

about your values there is this list of

values online and if you have some time

I think it's cool to kind of go over it

and pick three that really resonate with

you and then try to see if you can fit

your goals to your certain values and if

you notice that some of your goals don't

really fit your core values it is maybe

a good moment to reflect if these goals

fit you and fit the life that you want

to lead so these were my tips for

increasing motivation if you have any

tips for me I would love to hear them so
